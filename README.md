# Computer Graphics Labs

## Overview

Welcome to the Computer Graphics Labs repository! This collection consists of five web-based programs, each demonstrating a unique aspect of computer graphics. These programs are designed to showcase various techniques and concepts essential to the field of computer graphics.

## Lab Programs

1. **Drawing Parallelograms**: A simple program to draw parallelograms using HTML5 Canvas.
2. **Bezier Curves**: Demonstrates the drawing of Bezier curves, a fundamental tool in vector graphics.
3. **Fractals**: Draws both geometric fractals (like the Hartter-Dragon) and an algebraic fractal, illustrating the complexity and beauty of fractal geometry.
4. **Color Schemes**: Transfers colors between different color schemes, showcasing color theory and manipulation.
5. **Affine Transformations**: Animates a triangle using affine transformations, demonstrating the basics of transformations in computer graphics.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering graphics on the web.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used to create the interactive graphics.
